In this question we are given some xml and
html tags known and unknown to like h1 is known to us and this <Amee> is not 
so they are referring this to xml as there is a opening tag and closing tag.
If the syntax of the text looks good then we should print the text out otherwise we will print none.
Like <Amee>safat codes like a ninja</amee> in this case the opening tag <Amee> is capital and in closingtag </amee> is small is we wil print None.
