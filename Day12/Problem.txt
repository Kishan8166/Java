Question Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-static-initializer-block/problem?isFullScreen=true

The static initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded, and you can initialize static variables in those blocks.

It’s time to test your knowledge of Static initialization blocks. So, you can read about it by clicking on this link.

You’re given a class Solution with the main method. Complete the given code so that it will display the output of the area of a height H. You should read the variables from the standard input.

If B <=0 or H <=0, the outputs should be “java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive” without quotes.

Input Format:

So, there are two lines of the input. The first line contains the B: the breadth of the parallelogram. And the next line contains H: the height of the parallelogram.

Constraints
– 100 <= B <= 100
-100 <= H <= 100
Output Format
If both, values are greater than zero, then the main method must output an area of the parallelogram. If not then it should print “java.lang.Exception: Breadth and the height must be positive“. without quotes.

Sample Input 1
1
3
Sample Output 1
3
2nd Sample Input
-1
2
2nd Sample Output
java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive
Now we’ll see the solution for the above problem using different approaches.
