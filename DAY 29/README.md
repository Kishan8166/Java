Create a 1D array containing n integers in this HackerRankjava ID
Array problem. Modify the code in the loop so that it saves each sequential value to its corresponding location in the array.
For example, the first value must be stored in a0, the second value must be stored in a1, and so on.

Explanation
When we save each integer to its corresponding index in a, we get
a [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. The locked code prints each array element on a new line
from left to right.
