we are given an integer input, we have to determine the primitive datatypes of java that can store this integer. Java has 4 primitive datatypes for storing integers. They are

Byte: It can hold 8 bit signed integer
Short: It can hold 16-bit signed integer
Int: It can hold a 32-bit signed integer
Long: It can hold a 64-bit signed integer
Given an input, we have to print which of these datatypes are capable of storing it.

Test Cases:- 

Byte has 8 bits of space out of which 1 bit is reserved for the sign. Hence only 7 bits are available. Thus a bit can store values between -2^7 and 2^7 â€“ 1. Which is equivalent to -128 to 127.

Similarly, short can store values between -2^15 and 2^15-1 i.e. 32768 to 32787.

Int can store values between -2^32 and 2^32-1 i.e -2147483647 to 2147483648.

And long can store values between -2^64 and to 2^64-1.

We can use these conditions in our code to find out suitable data types.
