The HackerRank Java BigDecimal problem requires you to sort n real number strings in descending order provided an array, s, of n real number strings. But wait, there's more! It is necessary to print each number exactly as it is read from stdin, meaning .1 must be displayed as .1, and 0.1 must be displayed as 0.1. Similarly, if two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., .1 = 0.1), they must be listed as they were received.
