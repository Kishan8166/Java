Explanation

String s =  "Welcome to Java" has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length k = 3:

["ava",  "com", "elc", "eto", "jav", "lco", "met", "oja", "ome", "toj", "wel" ]

We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).

The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
